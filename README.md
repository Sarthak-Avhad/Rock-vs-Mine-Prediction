# 🚢 Rock vs Mine Prediction – Machine Learning Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning classification model** to predict whether an object detected by **sonar signals** is a **Rock** or a **Mine**.  
The dataset consists of sonar signal frequencies, and the goal is to accurately classify underwater objects using supervised learning techniques.
